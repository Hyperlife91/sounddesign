                        <h2>Purpose Of This Site</h2>
                        <p>Picture this: One day, you are playing a video game. You are having a lot of fun when suddenly, you hear what is called "a sound" by scientific experts. You are shaken to the core. What is this black magic? This sensation is... UNBELEIVABLE! You immediately set out to find answers to all of your questions about this phenomenon. Why did you hear it? Why was that specific noise chosen? Was that REALLY the Sound Designer's cat that made that strange, otherworldly noise? What's for dinner? Why does this website use gradients everywhere????? Your spiritual journey has taken you here, to this website, with this strangely relatable opening paragraph. You are but a child in the world of sound, and I shall guide you through these lands. I will show you the true power of Sountracks, Sound Effects, and Soundscape Design. Once you know my wisdom, I shall apply it to a game from this very country: Team Cherry's hit indie metroidvania, Hollow Knight.</p>
