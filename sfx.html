                    <h2>What Are Sound Effects?</h2>
                    <p>A Sound Effect, commonly abbreviated as 'SFX', is any sound in a game that triggers in response to something happening on screen. For example, the *thud* of a block hitting the ground after falling is a sound effect, but the ambient sounds changing when you enter a new area is not.</p>

                        <h2>SFX Creation</h2>
                        <p>SFX have been created in numerous ways, ranging from recording and distorting a cat waking up angrily to slamming an oven door shut and giving it a bunch of reverb. How do you create the sound of a footstep on magical jelly? Record yourself tapping your palm, add some sine waves, and add a WahWah! How do you make the sound of an eldritch blast? Play some synths and whisper into a microphone! A good Sound Designer will have many unusual tools to record anything they wish.</p>

                        <h2>SFX Design</h2>
                        <p>Before recording a Sound Effect, the Sound Designer must decide what the sound will actually sound like. This is done by closely analysing the event that will cause this sound. Some SFX are obvious, such as a gun firing or a crusher slamming down, but what sound would, for example, an otherworldly god make when she fires a ray of light at the player? What sound would a book that summons spiked discs make? The Sound Designer always figures it out.</p>
