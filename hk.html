                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Hollow Knight has an incredibly intricate Soundscape. Every track in the OST has 2 or 3 layers that are individually controlled by a variety of events, and has over 50 different ambience tracks that are used with eachother to create a rich, adaptive ambience that makes every area and every room feel unique.</p>

                            <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
                            <p>Hollow Knight's Soundtrack is rich and varied, and each track has at least 2 layers that fade in at different times. Most tracks follow the structure of: Main Layer that doesn't fade out often, Secondary Layer that fades in upon deeper exploration of the area, and an Action Layer that fades in during specific battles and platforming sections. There are two exceptions to this: The City of Tears has 2 Main tracks, one for Inside and one for Outside, and the Fog Canyon only has 1 Layer.</p>

                            <h2>Ambience</h2>
                            <p>Every location in the game has its own set of ambience tracks, usually 1 or 2, plus a variety of other tracks that fade in in different rooms. For example, Greenpath has a singular main ambience track: <span>green_path_atmos_loop.mp3</span>, and 2 generic ambience tracks that fade in in different areas: <span>cave_noises.mp3</span> in the Stone Sanctuary, and <span>atmos_archives.mp3</span> in The Lake Of Unn.</p>

                        <h2>Overall</h2>
                        <p>Hollow Knight's Soundscape is intricately designed to immerse the player in this fantasy bugworld, going so far as to have ambient tracks change not just between areas but between areas WITHIN ROOMS.</p>
