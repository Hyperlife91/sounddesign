                        <p>Soundtracks are the Musical elements of an overall Soundscape. They are one of the most important things in any Soundscape, and as such get a lot of love from both the composers and the players. Depending on the game, Soundtracks may have all sorts of different elements.</p>

                            <p>Celeste's Soundtrack is composed by Lena Raine, an American-Canadian composer who has gone on to compose for Minecraft. The Soundtrack very accurately reflects the mood of the game at all times, with most songs gaining or losing layers as you progress.</p>

                            <p>Risk Of Rain 2's Soundtrack is composed by Chris Christodolou, a Greek composer who also made the Soundtrack for the first Risk Of Rain. The Soundtrack does not adapt to the game environment much, merely switching tracks every area and bossfight, but it makes up for this with its sheer quality.</p>

                        <h2>Terraria</h2>
                            <p>Terraria's Soundtrack is composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly, a composer from Queensland. His music is one of the most iconic parts of Terraria, and bring so much life to the game. The Soundtrack changes based on biome, time of day, and elevation, leading to a variety of unique tracks for all places in the world. Most bosses have unique boss themes that are very memorable, to the point where hearing them gives you flashbacks to the first time you ever fought that boss (and were horribly dissected within mere seconds of its arrival).</p>
